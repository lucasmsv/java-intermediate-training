<p>This file contains some functions that I created to test intermediate programming logic in Java.</p>

<p>
  Some of the project's functions are:
  <ul>
    <li>Sorting the values of a vector without built-in methods</li>
    <li>Counting vowels and consonants in a text</li>
    <li>Counting the total number of characters in a text without spaces</li>
    <li>Verifiyng prime numbers</li>
    <li>Summing the total values of a matrix</li>
    <li>Reversing the values of a vector</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>The project's is part of my Java learning journey.</p>
